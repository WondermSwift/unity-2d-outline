# Outline Shader for Unity
This is based on [https://github.com/IronWarrior/UnityOutlineShader](https://github.com/IronWarrior/UnityOutlineShader) and is simply something I hacked together to get an outline on particles.

It's not very well tested, and probably has some issues, but hey, I made a nice gif about it! :)
